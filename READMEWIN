==================================

Requrements:
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2003
    - It is ok to use the express version of 2k5
    - Alternatively, you can use the command-line Visual C++ Toolkit:
        The tools can be downloaded for free from:
        http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/
        http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/
        However, you don't get a build system.  If you are interested
        you can convert our build system to some other freeware build.
* Boost - http://www.boost.org/
    - Instructions for building here: http://www.boost.org/
    - Use the vc7.1 target.
    - It is ok to just install the boost header files - Enblend does not
      use any boost libraries.
* libtiff - http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/
    - I've gotten it working using v3.7.0
    - Instructions for building are here: 
        http://www.remotesensing.org:16080/libtiff/build.html#PC
* Let MSVC know about these libraries
    - Go to Tools|Options|Projects|VC++ Directories
    - Under "Include files" put in the directories for the boost and libtiff
      include files.  For me this is "D:\Projects\Tools\include\boost-1_31"
      and "D:\Projects\Tools\include\libtiff"
    - Under "Library files" put in the directories for the boost and libtiff
      library files.  For me this is "d:\projects\tools\lib"

To Build:
Start VS and load enblend.sln
Hit Ctrl+Shift+B to build.
Find the binary in enblend/src/Debug|Release

The Windows binary release of Enblend includes the following components:
