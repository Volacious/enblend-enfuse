    Released enblend-0.9

March 27, 2004
    Released enblend-1.0

    - Replaced erosive thinning algorithm for mask creation with a much faster
      nearest feature transform.

    - Reduced memory requirements. Enblend now swaps most of its data to disk
      as temporary files. Enblend also calculates the region of pixels that
      are involved in each blending step and only does math on those pixels,
      improving speed and memory usage.

    - Added options to limit the number of blending levels used.
      This can reduce memory usage and improve speed, at a loss of quality.

    - Added an option to blend around the -180/+180 degree boundary.
      There is still an open issue as to how to handle the zenith and nadir.

    - Added an option to blend the input images sequentially in the order
      given on the command line. Sometimes the assembler can make poor choices
      and seams will still be visible in the output.

April 3, 2004
    Released enblend-1.1

    - Fixed a bug in reading from temporary files that appeared on machines
      with different versions of GCC.

    - Fixed a boundary condition problem that lead to horizontal or vertical
      seams to appear in the output.

    - Fixed a bug where segments of an input image would appear on the far
      side of a blending zone. This would cause strange wedge-shaped artifacts
      in some output images.

April 26, 2004
    Released enblend-1.2

    - Fixed a bug where 8-bit TIFFS would not be identified properly on
      big-endian machines.

    - A second (better) fix for the boundary condition problem that lead
      to horizontal or vertical seams to appear in the output.
