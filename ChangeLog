	* ChangeLog: Incremented version to 1.2.

2004-04-26 19:29  mihal

	* src/bounds.cc: Backed out the old fix for the boundary condition
	  issue.

2004-04-26 19:28  mihal

	* src/enblend.cc: Changed bitsPerSample to a 16-bit int for
	  big-endian machines.

2004-04-18 00:31  mihal

	* configure.in, src/blend.cc, src/bounds.cc, src/io.cc,
	  src/pyramid.cc: Fixed another boundary issue problem in the
	  pyramid code that caused seams to appear in some output images. A
	  shortcut I used to caluclate pyramid level sizes turned out to
	  not be general enough.

2004-04-03 00:26  mihal

	* configure.in: Incremented version to 1.1.

2004-04-03 00:15  mihal

	* ChangeLog, configure.in: Bumped the version to 1.01.

2004-04-03 00:00  mihal

	* src/: bounds.cc, enblend.h, io.cc, mask.cc, pyramid.cc: Fixed
	  boundary condition problem when expanding masks and the ROI is
	  tight.  Fixed bug in copyExcludedPixels when the whiteImage
	  extended past the other side of the ROI.

2004-04-02 22:51  mihal

	* src/: bounds.cc, enblend.cc, enblend.h: Fixed a bug in calling
	  fseek with SEEK_CUR when the goal is to move the file pointer
	  backwards. Put some parentheses around the expression I was
	  trying to negate. There is a signed/unsigned problem and the
	  compiler behavior is different on different machines.

2004-03-27 13:09  mihal

	* ChangeLog: Checking in the changelog for 1.0 release.

2004-03-27 13:01  mihal

	* src/: assemble.cc, enblend.cc: Changed the behavior of the -s
	  flag to sequentially blend images in the order given on the
	  command line, regardless of overlap.

2004-03-26 23:07  mihal

	* src/bounds.cc: Free some memory earlier.

2004-03-26 23:07  mihal

	* src/io.cc: Moved temporary files to the current directory,
	  because it may use multiple gigabytes in /tmp and not everyone
	  has that much space.

2004-03-26 18:05  mihal

	* src/enblend.cc: Added a catch for non-8-bit TIFFs - print a
	  useful message instead of just crashing.

2004-03-26 17:50  mihal

	* src/: enblend.cc, mask.cc, pyramid.cc: Fixed wraparound boundary
	  condition in expand.	Enabled wraparound option in main.

2004-03-26 16:48  mihal

	* src/: assemble.cc, bounds.cc, enblend.cc, mask.cc, nearest.cc,
	  pyramid.cc: Fixed corner cases where: Black image is entirely
	  inside white image.  Transition line is horizontal or vertical.
	  Input images have semitransparent pixels.  Distance calculation
	  overflow in nearest feature transform.

2004-03-25 22:29  mihal

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, missing, src/assemble.cc,
	  src/blend.cc, src/bounds.cc, src/enblend.cc, src/enblend.h,

	  up the code and made the output messages easier to read.  Fixed a
	  bug in copyExcludedPixels when the ROI does not encompass the
	  entire image intersection region.

	* src/: Makefile.am, assemble.cc, blend.cc, bounds.cc, enblend.cc,
	  enblend.h, io.cc, mask.cc, nearest.cc, pyramid.cc: Most data
